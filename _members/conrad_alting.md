Conrad completed his master's degree in psychology at Bielefeld University after initial studies in medicine and biochemistry. A tinkerer from early on, he developed a passion for the technical aspects of experimental psychology. After working as a research assistant at Bielefeld University on a DFG-funded project on gaze perception, he joined the team in September 2025 as lab manager. In this role, he is responsible for maintaining and developing the lab infrastructure, as well as establishing a central hub for coordinating lab resources and the technical realization of research projects. Outside of work, he enjoys running in the Teutoburg Forest, birding and hiking in the Bavarian Alps.
