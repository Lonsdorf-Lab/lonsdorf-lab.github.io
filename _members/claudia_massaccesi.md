Claudia studied Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Bologna (Italy) and received her PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Vienna (Austria) in 2022. Following a visiting research period at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), she completed her first post-doc at the Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience unit of the University of Vienna. She joined our team as a post-doc in 2024 to investigate the effects of early adversity on social behavior and social functioning.  Her research focuses on the psychological, neurochemical, and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying social motivation and reward, and combines neuroimaging, psychopharmacology, and behavioral methods.
